\title{Original Dixon and Mood (1948) point estimate}
\usage{
dixonmood(x, y, full = FALSE, flip = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector: sequence of administered doses, treatments, stimuli, etc.}

\item{y}{numeric vector: sequence of observed responses. Must be same length as \code{x} or shorter by 1, and must be coded \code{TRUE/FALSE} or 0/1.}

\item{full}{logical: should more detailed information be returned, or only the estimate? (default \code{FALSE})}

\item{flip}{logical: should we flip D-M's approach and use the more-common outcome? (default \code{FALSE})}
}
\value{
The point estimate
}
\description{
Basic version; formula assumes uniform spacing but should work anyway
}
\details{
In their documentation of the Up-and-Down algorithm, Dixon and Mood (1948) presented an estimation method based on tallying and averaging responses, choosing to use only the positive or negative responses (the less-common of the two), since they reasoned the two mirror each other. This is not strictly true: it ignores both leading/trailing "tail" sequences of identical responses, and repeated visits to the boundary dose in case there are dose boundaries.

The Dixon-Mood estimate (sometimes called Dixon-Massey) is provided here mostly for historical reasons and comparative-simulation uses, and also because this estimate is apparently \emph{(and unfortunately)} still in use in some fields. \strong{It should not be used for actual target-dose estimation in real experiments.} It behaves very poorly even under minor deviations from the most optimal conditions (see, e.g., simulations in the supplement to Oron et al. 2022.).

In order to discourage from actual use in experiments, we do not provide a method for the Dixon-Mood estimator's confidence interval, even though the original article did include one. The interval estimate behaves even more poorly than the point estimate.

For UDD target estimation we recommend using centered isotonic regression, available via \code{\link{udest}}, an up-and-down adapted wrapper to \code{cir::quickInverse()}. See Oron et al. 2022 (both article and supplement) for further information, as well as the \code{cir} package vignette.
