\title{Up-and-Down averaging estimate with adaptive starting-point}
\usage{
adaptmean(x, maxExclude = 1/3, before = FALSE, full = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector: sequence of administered doses, treatments, stimuli, etc.}

\item{maxExclude}{a fraction in \eqn{0,1} indicating the maximum initial fraction of the vector \code{x} to exclude from averaging, in case the algorithm-identified starting point occurs too late in the experiment. Default 1/3.}

\item{before}{logical: whether to start the averaging one step earlier than the starting reversal point. Default \code{FALSE}, and ignored when \code{all=FALSE}.}

\item{full}{logical: should more detailed information be returned, or only the estimate? (default \code{FALSE})}

\description{
A dose-averaging estimate based on a concept from Oron (2007). Provides an alternative to reversal-based averaging.
}
\details{
Historically, most up-and-down studies have used dose-averaging estimates. Many of them focus on reversal points either as anchor/cutoff points -- points where the averaging begins -- or as the \strong{only} doses to use in the estimate.  Excluding doses before the anchor/cutoff is done in order to mitigate the bias due to the arbitrary location of the starting dose. The extent of excluded sample depends on the distance between the starting dose and the
up-and-down balance point, as well as the random-walk vagaries of an individual experimental run.

Oron (2007) showed that using only reversals and skipping other doses is generally a bad idea, and also noted that a reversal anchor point is not directly tied to the conceptual motivation for having an anchor/cutoff point.

In practice, some \emph{"lucky"} experiments might not need any exclusion at all (because they started right at the balance point), while others might need to exclude dozens of observations. Reversals do not capture this variability well.

The estimation method coded in \code{adaptmean()} works from a different principle. It identifies \strong{the first crossing point:} the first point at which
the dose is \emph{"on the other side"} from the starting point, compared with the average of all remaining doses.
The average of all remaining doses is used as a proxy to the (unobservable) balance point.
This approach is far closer to capturing the dynamics described above, and indeed performs well
in comparative simulations (Oron et al. 2022, Supplement).

Interestingly, unlike other methods \code{adaptmean()} does not require the experiment's binary responses as input; only the dose-allocation sequence.

The reason \code{adaptmean()} has not been further developed nor published, is that like all dose-averaging estimators,
at present there doesn't seem to be a reliable confidence interval to accompany any of them.

For UDD target estimation we recommend using centered isotonic regression, a more robust method available
together with a confidence interval via \code{\link{udest}}, an up-and-down adapted wrapper to \code{cir::quickInverse()}.
See Oron et al. 2022 (both article and supplement) for further information, as well as the \code{cir} package vignette.
