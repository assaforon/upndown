Title: Utilities and Design Aids for Up-and-Down Dose-Finding Studies
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2023-06-05
Description: Up-and-Down is the most popular design approach for dose-finding, but has been severely under-served by the statistical computing community. This is the first package to address Up-and-Down's needs. For a recent methodological tutorial on Up-and-Down, see Oron et al. (2022) <doi:10.1097/ALN.0000000000004282>.
